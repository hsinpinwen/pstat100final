# Abstract
This report delves into the 2023 World Happiness Report dataset, examining how various
factors influence happiness and well-being across countries from 2008 to 2023. The analysis
explores relationships between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and several key
factors: life ladder, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, perceptions of corruption, and positive and negative affects. The primary focus is to investigate
how economic wealth, as measured by GDP per capita, correlates with these happiness and
well-being indicators over time. Through visualizations and statistical tests, the report identifies significant patterns and trends, providing a deeper understanding of the socio-economic
factors that contribute to the quality of life in different nations. Additionally, the report
includes a comparative study of life expectancy trends between China and the United States,
bringing light to the complex interplay between economic conditions and health outcomes.
